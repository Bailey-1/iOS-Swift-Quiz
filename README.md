#  TriviaGame!

It uses Open trivia DB's API to request questions.

## Features:

- Thousands of questions that are fetched from the API.

- Customisable settings:
- Category of questions
- Number of Questions
- Type of Questions - Multiple choice or True and False
- Selectable difficulty

- Buttons light up Green or Red when pressed to indicate that the answer was Right or Wrong

- Progress bar

## TODO:

- Still some occasional bugs that prevent answers from being selected / allowing the user to progress.
- Ive fixed most of these but there are still some that remain.

- Clean the project because it got messy in the middle.

- Fix a couple of bits to ensure that it does comply fully with MVC.

## What I learned:

- I learnt alot about using segues and unwinding segues

- My knowledge of MVC and the Delegate design patterns has improved.

- ... that I need to improve my UI / UX design lmao. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
